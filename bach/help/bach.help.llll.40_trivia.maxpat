In fact, bach itself has been born as a context able to sustain and nourish the graceful \"llll\" lexeme. After this little gem has presented itself to our flattered minds we could not help wondering how to give it life and let all the world know about it, and so bach was conceived.\n\nAs far as the pronounciation is concerned, well, it's completely up to you. You can give it the sound of the name of your beloved one, or your dearest pet, or your favourite chocolate cake or alcoholic drink. However, if you don't feel ready to indulge in your deepest feelings and emotions, you can settle upon some more lexicographically descriptive choice. As far as we are concerned, we always use the \"el-el-el-el\" pronunciation (a bit like a tongue-twister!). But other choices are available -  e.g., \"four-l\", or \"quatre l\" as Mr. Emmanuel Jourdan suggested: though in this case, we would definitely argue that \"four-l\" actually means l+l+l+l, whereas we are rather dealing with llll, that is l^4, \"l-to-the-fourth\", or at the most \"l-four\", if you will.\n\nSo please take all the time you need to choose the sound of llll with care and dedication, and don't bother with all the whistles and bells, max objects, abstractions, tutorials, data types or whatever: they really don't deserve your attention as much as that single, lovely llll does.",
