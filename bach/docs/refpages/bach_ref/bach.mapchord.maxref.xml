				A lambda inlet is an inlet receiving the answer from a test or modification performed on elements sent out the lambda outlets. <br />
				In this case, the answer is expected to be a modification of the elements which had been sent out:
				the element output via the lambda outlet can be customly modified and then plugged in into this lambda inlet:
				such modification will be accounted for by the algorithm. <br />
				The lambda inlet also accepts the result in llll form, so you can sometimes avoid the explicit @out t. <br />
				It is important to know that the evaluation chain inside the lambda loop must be direct: you can't use objects such as <o>delay</o>,
				<o>pipe</o>, <o>defer</o>; nor store the value anywhere waiting for some other event to trigger it. Also see #lambda in the bach Help Center.

				Outlet Types
			</digest>
			<description>
				The <m>out</m> attribute is a sequence of characters identifying the outlet types (one character for each llll outlet). Characters can be one of the followings: <br />
				<m>n</m> (default): 'native' output: faster and more precise between bach objects, but unreadable by standard Max objects (an "bach.llll" message appears instead). <br />
				<m>t</m>: 'text' output: slower and limited in size, but readable by standard Max objects. A plain llll in text format is a generic Max message. <br />
				<m>x</m>: disabled output (nothing is output) <br />
				<m>p</m>: 'portal' output: only used by bach.portal to intercept the @out attribute specified while creating the abstraction (see bach.portal). <br />
				The native output is recommended, unless communication with standard Max messages is needed. Disabling unused outputs can be useful if extreme optimization of the patch is needed.

			<description>
				If the <m>treepath</m> attribute is set to 1, the chord path output from the second lambda outlet,
				for <o>bach.score</o>, is the path of the chord llll inside the whole gathered syntax tree structure (including possible
				rhythmic tree levels). If <m>treepath</m> is set to 0, the output path, for <o>bach.score</o>, is only composed by
				<b><m>voice_num</m> <m>meas_num</m> <m>chord_idx</m></b>, where <m>chord_idx</m> is the index of the chord inside the measure
				(counting from 1). This latter case is the default. Notice that for a <o>bach.roll</o> syntax, on the other hand, this attribute
				has no effect, as the output path is always composed by <b><m>voice_num</m> <m>chord_idx</m></b>.

	<!--DISCUSSION-->
	<discussion>
		The iteration is performed until a chord element is found (both for <o>bach.roll</o> and <o>bach.score</o>).
		This especially also works if rhythmic tree levels are present.
		The chord llll is output from the first lambda outlet, preceded by the chord path
		(from the second lambda outlet). The chord is supposed to be modified then by patching,
		and the modified llll is expected to be received in the lambda inlet. <br />
		A certain number of bach objects are equipped with "lambda" inlets and outlets. These inlets and outlets -
		always the rightmost ones - serve the purpose of letting you define a function the object will base its behavior upon.
		Such function is indeed a patching loop: parameters are taken from the lambda outlet(s), processed, and the "result" is
		plugged in the lambda inlet(s). The type of function, and the corresponding expected result, depend on the object behavior;
		for instance, cycles modifying elements will expect as "result" the modified element; cycles testing for custom equalities will
		expect a 0/1 answer (0 meaning: not equal; 1 meaning: equal), as well as cycles testing custom inequalities and sorting (1 meaning: the two
		elements are in the correct order; 0 meaning: the order is wrong). Refer to each specific object to know more about it.
		With many objects, it is not mandatory to provide an evaluation cycle: if you don't, a default function will be used. <br />
		It is important to know that the evaluation chain inside the lambda loop must be direct: you can't use objects such as <o>delay</o>,
		<o>pipe</o>, <o>defer</o>; nor store the value anywhere waiting for some other event to trigger it. Also see #lambda in the bach Help Center.
