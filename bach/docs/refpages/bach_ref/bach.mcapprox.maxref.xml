				In the bach environment, the tone division defines the microtonal accuracy of the symbolic representation,
				by representing the number of steps in which each tone is divided.
				For the standard semitonal representation (where just sharps and flats suffice), one can stick with
				<m>tonedivision</m> being 2, meaning: the tone is divided into two semitones.
				By increasing this value, the microtonal grid gets more dense: for instance, 4 is the quartertonal grid
				(where each tone is divided in 4 quartertones); 8 is the eight-tonal grid, and so on.

				The function outputs an llll formatted as the incoming one, where each numeric
				element has been replaced by the nearest element in the choosen temperament.
				For instance, if the modulo is 12, the number 6020 would be snapped to the number 6000
				(precise midicents of middle C). The same number, with modulo = 48, would be snapped to 6025
				(one eighth-tone above). The temperament is defined by the tone division, set in the right inlet.

			<description>
				The <m>out</m> attribute is a sequence of characters identifying the outlet types (one character for each llll outlet). Characters can be one of the followings: <br />
				<m>n</m> (default): 'native' output: faster and more precise between bach objects, but unreadable by standard Max objects (an "bach.llll" message appears instead). <br />
				<m>t</m>: 'text' output: slower and limited in size, but readable by standard Max objects. A plain llll in text format is a generic Max message. <br />
				<m>x</m>: disabled output (nothing is output) <br />
				<m>p</m>: 'portal' output: only used by bach.portal to intercept the @out attribute specified while creating the abstraction (see bach.portal). <br />
				The native output is recommended, unless communication with standard Max messages is needed. Disabling unused outputs can be useful if extreme optimization of the patch is needed.

	<!--DISCUSSION-->
	<discussion>
		The conversion depends on the microtonal division, which is the <m>tonedivision</m> attribute
		of <o>bach.roll</o> and <o>bach.score</o>.
		The relationship with the modulo is: modulo/6 = tonedivision. <br /> <br />
		In the bach environment, the tone division defines the microtonal accuracy of the symbolic representation,

		In the standard framework, the modulo is the number of subdivision of the octave (represented as a circle). The modulo is thus the number of
		points in this circle. The default and most common modulo is 12 (corresponding to semitonal grid). Modulo 24 is the quartertone grid, and so on.
